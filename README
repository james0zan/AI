===========================
Overview
===========================

Anticipating Invariant (AI) is a novel invariant that can 
anticipate the concurrency bugs (CBugs) right before their turning points.
It enables the users to forestall the failures caused by CBugs 
with a simple thread stalling technique, rather than resort to roll-back.

In this package, we present:
1) the source code of our LLVM-based AI implementation (`ai/*`);
2) several demos for demonstrating AI's ability of tolerating CBugs (`demo/*`);
3) applications from different categories (desktop, server, hpc) for evaluating AI's overhead (`performance/*`);
and 4) an example of the APIs' usage (`api/*`).

Documentations, screencasts and some auxiliary scripts are also provided.

Documentation
===========================

The documentations of AI are distributed in:
1) the files under the `doc/` directory;
2) the `README` file of each subdirectory;
and 3) the annotations in the `Makefile` file.

A recommended oder of reading these documentations is given below:
