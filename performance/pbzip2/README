Description
===========================

PBZIP2 is a popular parallel implementation of the bzip2 block-sorting file compressor 
that uses pthreads and achieves near-linear speedup on SMP machines. 
We use it as an example for demonstrating AI's performance on normal desktop applications.

===========================
Compile
===========================

  cd $AI_ARCHIVE_DIR/performance/pbzip2
  tar xvf pbzip2-1.1.6.tar.gz

  mv Makefile.ai pbzip2-1.1.6/Makefile
  cd pbzip2-1.1.6/
  make train
  make relax
  make test

  # Relaxing the BSets
  python ../run.py relax 30 ./pbzip2

  # Now you can test the overhead by yourself with
  # the native app pbzip2.native and
  # the instrumented app pbzip2.instrumented.
  # Or you can use our test framework.
  python ../run.py test 10 ./pbzip2

Expected Results
===========================

In our experiments, the result is:
Average Overhead: 0.001262 ~ 0.003815
